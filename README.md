# ðŸ“ƒ Description
This project is my submission for Dicoding Create Front-End Web for Beginners Course. I use media queries to customize layouts on various device screen sizes and localStorage to store book data.

Here are the criterias:
- Bookshelf Apps must be Able to add new book data, stored book data is a JavaScript object.
- Bookshelf Apps must have 2 Bookshelves; "Not finished reading" and "Finished reading". "Not finished reading" only stores books which isComplete property is false.
"Finished reading" only saves books which isComplete property is true.
- Books displayed on the shelf must be able to be moved between the two bookshelves.
- Books displayed on the shelf must be able to be removed.
- Use localStorage in storing book data.

For this project I added a search feature to filter the books displayed on the shelves according to the book titles written in the search field and I also added a custom dialog confirmation when removing a book.
